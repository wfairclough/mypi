# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains Raspberry Pi scripts for the G50-W25 CEGEP course. The scripts are written in bash and intended to configure the Raspberry Pi with common tools used in this class.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured for educational purposes as part of a CEGEP course (G50-W25). Files and scripts will be organized to support Raspberry Pi development and experimentation.

## Development Environment

This project targets Raspberry Pi hardware. When developing scripts:
- Assume scripts may need to run on Raspberry Pi OS (Debian-based)
- Assume Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is the intended target
- Consider ARM 64 architecture compatibility when suggesting dependencies
- Be mindful of GPIO pin access and hardware-specific requirements

## Setup Process

### Running the Setup Script

To configure a Raspberry Pi with all development tools:

```bash
sudo ./init.sh setup
```

**Important**: The script MUST be run with sudo as it installs system-wide packages.

### What the Script Does

1. Updates system packages (`apt update && apt upgrade`)
2. Installs apt packages (git, jq, yq, htop, zoxide, tldr, ripgrep, tmux, lazygit, httpie)
3. Installs GitHub CLI (gh) via official apt repository
4. Downloads and installs GitHub releases with SHA256 verification:
   - neovim (v0.11.5)
   - bat (v0.26.0)
   - asdf (v0.18.0)
   - fzf (v0.66.1)
5. Runs curl-based installers for atuin and astral uv
6. Sets up LazyVim configuration for neovim
7. Copies `config/env` to `~/.config/myrpi/env`
8. Modifies `~/.bashrc` to source the environment file

### Script Features

- **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times; skips already-installed tools
- **Error handling**: Stops on any error (`set -e`)
- **SHA256 verification**: Verifies checksums for downloaded binaries
- **User preservation**: Runs installations as the actual user (not root) when appropriate

## Extending the Setup Script

### Adding New Tools

The script is designed for easy extension. To add a new tool:

1. **For apt packages**: Add to the `packages` array in `install_apt_packages()`

2. **For GitHub releases**: Call `install_github_release` in the `setup()` function:
   ```bash
   install_github_release "tool-name" "https://github.com/.../tool.tar.gz" "sha256hash" "extracted-dir-name"
   ```

3. **For curl scripts**: Call `install_curl_script` in the `setup()` function:
   ```bash
   install_curl_script "tool-name" "bash <(curl -sSL https://...)"
   ```

4. **For custom installs**: Create a new `install_toolname()` function and call it in `setup()`

### Environment Configuration

The `config/env` file contains:
- PATH modifications for all installed tools
- Tool-specific configurations (bat theme, fzf settings)
- Useful aliases (cat→bat, cd→zoxide)
- Custom shell functions (mkcd, extract, note)
- Shell prompt with git branch display
- History settings and shell options

To add new configurations, edit `config/env` and they'll be applied on next shell restart.

## Git Workflow

- Main branch: `main`
- This repository is part of an educational setting (CEGEP course G50-W25)
